This project aims to provide a simple Web interface for EBLook which can be invoked in browser using Javascript to provide similar function to Rikaichan. Stardict format is also supported, and other popular dictionary formats can be supported in the future (such as ZDic, MDict, ... hopefully) once their specs are known.

Programming language: Python

Milestones:
  1. Web interface for dictionary query and management (done)
  1. Stardict format support (done)
  1. EPWING format support through EBLook pipe
  1. Javascript for mouse-point-and-translate in any Web page

Any contribution is welcome.
