		Welcome to the world of "your opensource license is better

	Comment:
		I think the license is compatible with the MIT license used by
		this project as long as I do not modify the content of
		dictzip.py, according to the free-linking addition in the
		original license claim.
		If I am wrong, please feel free to point it out.
